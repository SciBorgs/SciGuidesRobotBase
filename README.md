# SciGuides Robot Base

This is the base repository used for projects in [SciGuides](https://github.com/SciBorgs/SciGuides). It is based on [Hydrogen](https://github.com/SciBorgs/Hydrogen), the base repository for the SciBorgs.

This repository is a *template*. To create your own repo from this template (i.e. for a SciGuides project), follow [these instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template#creating-a-repository-from-a-template).

## Codespaces

You can work on your robot code using github codespaces! This will allow you to develop and contribute from any computer, without worrying about installing anything.

To open in codespaces, press on the arrow below the green `Code` button and open the Codespaces tab. Then press `Create codespace on main`.
